\chapter{Integration strategy}\label{chap:strategy}

\section{Entry criteria}\textbf{Specify the criteria that must be met before integration testing of specific elements may begin (e.g., functions must have been unit tested).}


\section{Elements to be integrated}\textbf{Identify the components to be integrated, refer to your design document to identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design.}


\section{Integration testing strategy}
\textbf{Describe the integration testing approach (top down, bottom up, functional groupings, etc.) and the rationale for the choosing that approach.}
\section{Sequence of Component/Function Integration}\textbf{NOTE: The structure of this section may vary depending on the integration strategy you select in Section 2.3. Use the structure proposed below as a non mandatory guide.}

\subsection{Software Integration Sequence}
\textbf{For each subsystem: Identify the sequence in which the software components will be integrated within the subsystem. Relate this sequence to any product features/functions that are being built up.}\subsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence}
\textbf{Identify the order in which subsystems will be integrated.}

If you have a single subsystem, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 are to be merged in a single section. You can refer to Section 2.2 of the test plan example [1] as an example of what we expect.
