\chapter{Alloy model}\label{chap:appendix}

To provide a validation of our model, we provide an Alloy code:

\lstinputlisting[language=alloy]{./alloy/myTaxiService.als}

This is the result of the final computation:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
5 commands were executed. The results are:
   #1: No counterexample found. noMultipleAllocations may be valid.
   #2: No counterexample found. oneActiveReservation may be valid.
   #3: Instance found. showNoReservation is consistent.
   #4: Instance found. showFaultReport is consistent.
   #5: Instance found. show is consistent.
\end{Verbatim}
