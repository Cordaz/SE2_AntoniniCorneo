\section*{Changes in the structure}
Given the architecture of our system, we decided not to subdivide \cref{sec:intsequence} (``Integration sequence''), unlike it was suggested. We rearranged chapters 4 and 5 of the suggested structure into two sections of a single chapter, since logically related.

Also, we slightly changed some section titles for the sake of clarity and conciseness.
