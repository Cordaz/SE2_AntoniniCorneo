\section{Overview of the document}	
This document develops as follows. \Cref{chap:architectural} analyses the architectural design of the system: every module will be described, as well as its interaction with the other components. Some UML diagrams will be used as a support. \Cref{chap:algorithm} defines the most relevant algorithm used in the system. In \cref{chap:userinterface} we offer an overview on how the user interfaces of your system will look like, through some mock-ups. Finally, \cref{chap:traceability} shows any correspondence between the requirements defined in our RASD and the design elements expressed in this document.
