\chapter{Reference - Java checklist}\label[rule]{chap:reference}

\section{Naming Conventions}\begin{enumerate}
\item \label[rule]{item:1}All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
\item \label[rule]{item:2}If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary ``throwaway'' variables, such as those used in for loops.
\item \label[rule]{item:3}Class names are nouns, in mixed case, with the first letter of each word in capitalized. Examples: \texttt{class Raster}; \texttt{class ImageSprite};
\item \label[rule]{item:4}Interface names should be capitalized like classes.
\item \label[rule]{item:5}Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized. Examples: \texttt{getBackground()}; \texttt{computeTemperature()}. 
\item \label[rule]{item:6}Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore (`\texttt{\_}') followed by a lowercase first letter. All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples: \texttt{\_windowHeight}, \texttt{timeSeriesData}.
\item \label[rule]{item:7}Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: \texttt{MIN\_WIDTH}; \texttt{MAX\_HEIGHT}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Indention}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:8}Three or four spaces are used for indentation and done so consistently.
\item \label[rule]{item:9}No tabs are used to indent.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Braces}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:10}Consistent bracing style is used, either the preferred ``Allman'' style (first brace goes underneath the opening block) or the ``Kernighan and Ritchie'' style (first brace is on the same line of the instruction that opens the new block).
\item \label[rule]{item:11}All \texttt{if}, \texttt{while}, \texttt{do-while}, \texttt{try-catch}, and \texttt{for} statements that have only one statement to execute are surrounded by curly braces. Example:
avoid this:

\begin{minted}[showtabs=false, linenos=false,frame=leftline]{java}
	if ( condition )
		doThis();
\end{minted}

instead do this:

\begin{minted}[showtabs=false, linenos=false,frame=leftline]{java}
	if ( condition ) 
	{
		doThis(); 
	}
\end{minted}

\end{enumerate}

\section{File Organization}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:12}Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections (beginning comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).
\item \label[rule]{item:13}Where practical, line length does not exceed 80 characters.
\item \label[rule]{item:14}When line length must exceed 80 characters, it does NOT exceed 120 characters.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Wrapping Lines}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:15}Line break occurs after a comma or an operator.
\item \label[rule]{item:16}Higher-level breaks are used.
\item \label[rule]{item:17}A new statement is aligned with the beginning of the expression at the same level as the previous line.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comments}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:18}Comments are used to adequately explain what the class, interface, methods, and blocks of code are doing.
\item \label[rule]{item:19}Commented out code contains a reason for being commented out and a date it can be removed from the source file if determined it is no longer needed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Java Source Files}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:20}Each Java source file contains a single public class or interface.
\item \label[rule]{item:21}The public class is the first class or interface in the file.
\item \label[rule]{item:22}Check that the external program interfaces are implemented consistently with what is described in the javadoc.
\item \label[rule]{item:23}Check that the javadoc is complete (i.e., it covers all classes and files part of the set of classes assigned to you).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Package and Import Statements}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:24}If any package statements are needed, they should be the first non-comment statements. Import statements follow.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Class and Interface Declarations}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \label[rule]{item:25}The class or interface declarations shall be in the following order:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \label[rule]{item:25a}class/interface documentation comment;
		\item \label[rule]{item:25b}class or interface statement;
		\item \label[rule]{item:25c}class/interface implementation comment, if necessary;
		\item \label[rule]{item:25d}class (static) variables;
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \label[rule]{item:25di}first public class variables;
			\item \label[rule]{item:25dii}next protected class variables;
			\item \label[rule]{item:25diii}next package level (no access modifier);
			\item \label[rule]{item:25div}last private class variables.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \label[rule]{item:25e}instance variables;
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \label[rule]{item:25ei}first public instance variables;
			\item \label[rule]{item:25eii}next protected instance variables;
			\item \label[rule]{item:25eiii}next package level (no access modifier);
			\item \label[rule]{item:25eiv}last private instance variables.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \label[rule]{item:25f}constructors;
		\item \label[rule]{item:25g}methods.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \label[rule]{item:26}Methods are grouped by functionality rather than by scope or accessibility.
	\item \label[rule]{item:27}Check that the code is free of duplicates, long methods, big classes, breaking encapsulation, as well as if coupling and cohesion are adequate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Initialization and Declarations}\begin{enumerate}[resume]
