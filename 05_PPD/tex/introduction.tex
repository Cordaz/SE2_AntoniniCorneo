\section{Purpose and scope}
After the long planning phase which myTaxiService underwent in the past months, it seems appropriate to define a precise planning for its development, as well as identify its supposed cost and the needed effort to implement it.

With this document we aim to reach this goal.



\section{References}\label{sec:references}
In the following chapters we will refer to the following documents:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{COCOMO II.2000 model manual}: \url{http://csse.usc.edu/csse/research/COCOMOII/cocomo2000.0/CII_modelman2000.0.pdf}.
	\item \emph{Function Point Languages Table}: \url{http://www.qsm.com/resources/function-point-languages-table}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Overview of the document} 
This document develops as follows.

In \cref{chap:estimation} Function Points and COCOMO methods are applied in order to estimate the effort and cost to develop the project; the justification for some choices we made is left to \cref{chap:justification}, in order no to clutter \cref{chap:estimation} itself. \Cref{chap:allocation} deals with the scheduling of tasks and allocation of resources. Finally, in \cref{chap:risk} we report the main risks the development of the project may encounter.
